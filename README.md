Samsung Jet Bot Intergration for Home assistant<br>

This is my first try at an intergration, hope it works!<br><br><br>Please give feedback and i will do the bast i can.<br> you will need a smarthings API key and the device Key for the vacuume.<br> the API key can be found here.<br><br>
https://account.smartthings.com/tokens<br><br>

to get the device ID (let me know if there is an easier way) use this link <br><br>https://my.smartthings.com/location<br><br>
Click on the vacuum once and the URL will change, you need the the text after the last slash.<br><br> For example - <br><br>https://my.smartthings.com/location/d11d0982-9bf9-4f0c-afd4-ad2d78862541/device/05accb39-2017-c98b-a5ab-04a81e4d3d9g<br><br> would translate to - <br><br> 05accb39-2017-c98b-a5ab-04a81e4d3d9g<br><br> going forward i will try and make this all happen from the API key.
